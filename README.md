## üõ† Installation Instructions

### üîπ Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
Install dependencies via `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgmp-dev libcln-dev libginac-dev pkg-config
```

### üîπ macOS (with Homebrew)
Install dependencies via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gmp cln ginac pkg-config
```

> Ensure that Homebrew‚Äôs `bin` and `lib` paths are visible to the compiler (especially when using RStudio).

### üîπ Windows  (RTools44 + MSYS2)
1. **Install‚ÄØRTools44**  
   Download and run the installer from  
   https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

2. **Open the ‚ÄúMSYS2 MinGW‚ÄØ64‚Äëbit‚Äù shell**  
   From the Start menu ‚Üí MSYS2 ‚Üí MSYS2 MinGW 64‚Äëbit

3. **Update the package database and install the toolchain + pkgconf**  
   ```bash
   pacman -Sy
   pacman -S --needed \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \
     pkgconf
   ```

4. **Install GMP**  
   ```bash
   pacman -S --needed \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-gmp
   ```

5. **Download, compile and install CLN and GiNaC**  
   CLN and GiNaC are not available via pacman; follow the instructions on their websites:  
   - **CLN (Class Library for Numbers):** https://www.ginac.de/cln  
   - **GiNaC (GiNaC is Not a CAS):** https://www.ginac.de  

   Example (adjust versions as needed):  
   ```bash
   # CLN
   curl -LO https://www.ginac.de/cln-1.3.8.tar.gz
   tar xf cln-1.3.8.tar.gz
   cd cln-1.3.8
   ./configure --prefix=/mingw64
   make
   make install

   # GiNaC
   curl -LO https://www.ginac.de/ginac-1.9.2.tar.gz
   tar xf ginac-1.9.2.tar.gz
   cd ginac-1.9.2
   ./configure --prefix=/mingw64
   make
   make install
   ```

6. **Make sure R sees the compilers**  
   In your R session (or add to your `~/.Renviron`):
   ```r
   Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(
     "C:/rtools44/mingw64/bin",
     Sys.getenv("PATH"),
     sep = ";"
   ))
   ```

7. **Build & install the package**  
   From your package root (in a cmd prompt or MSYS2 shell):
   ```bash
   R CMD build .
   R CMD INSTALL finitization_*.tar.gz
   ```

> Once the toolchain, `pkgconf`, GMP headers & libraries, and CLN/GiNaC are installed, you can install **finitization** exactly as on Linux or macOS.  
> If you encounter missing header or symbol errors, confirm that `/mingw64/include` and `/mingw64/lib` are on your compiler‚Äôs search path.  
> You may also use `devtools::install()` from within R for convenience.
> **Alternatively**, you can skip building CLN and GiNaC yourself: the package ships with precompiled static libraries and headers.  Use the `inst/include` directory for headers and `inst/extlibs/<arch>` for the `.a` files when compiling on Windows.

## üì¶ Building the Package

Once dependencies are installed, you can build and install the package from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bogdanoancea/finitization.git
cd finitization
R CMD build .
R CMD INSTALL finitization_0.1.0.tar.gz
```

Or use `devtools`:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bogdanoancea/finitization")
```

---

## üîç Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```r
library(finitization)
## basic example code
```

---

## üß™ Testing

To run tests:

```r
library(testthat)
testthat::test_package("finitization")
```
