## üõ† Installation Instructions

### üîπ Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
Install dependencies via `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgmp-dev libcln-dev libginac-dev pkg-config
```

### üîπ macOS (with Homebrew)
Install dependencies via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gmp cln ginac pkg-config
```

> Ensure that Homebrew‚Äôs `bin` and `lib` paths are visible to the compiler (especially when using RStudio).

### üîπ Windows
There is currently no automated installation for Windows. You need to:

1. Install **Rtools**: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
2. Manually install and build static versions of GMP, CLN, and GiNaC (e.g. via MSYS2 or build from source).
3. Ensure headers and libraries are discoverable via environment variables or placed where Rtools will find them.

> If you are unfamiliar with building C/C++ libraries on Windows, we recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or building the package on Linux/macOS.
