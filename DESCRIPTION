Package: finitization
Title: Finitization Methods for Discrete Probability Distributions
Description: Implements the finitization of discrete probability distributions, a technique that approximates a distribution by preserving a finite number of moments. These finitized distributions enable faster random variate generation than inverse transform sampling and are useful in simulation and statistical modeling.
