## Test environments
- Local macOS (M1 arm64), R 4.2.2
- Local macOS (Intel), R 4.2.2
- Local Windows 11 (x86_64), R 4.5.0

## Notes for CRAN

- The package uses static linking for the GMP, CLN, and GiNaC libraries when system versions are not found.
  - Precompiled static libraries are provided under `inst/extlibs/` for Windows and macOS:
    - Windows (x64): `inst/extlibs/x64/`
    - macOS Intel (x86_64): `inst/extlibs/x86_64/`
    - macOS ARM64 (M1/M2/M3): `inst/extlibs/arm64/`
  - On Linux systems, system libraries must be installed manually using the system package manager (e.g., `apt-get install libgmp-dev libcln-dev libginac-dev`).

- During R CMD check on Windows, a NOTE appears regarding the presence of `std::cout` and `std::cerr` symbols:
File ‘finitization/libs/finitization.so’:
Found ‘__ZNSt3__14cerrE’, possibly from ‘std::cerr’ (C++)
Found ‘__ZNSt3__14coutE’, possibly from ‘std::cout’ (C++)

This originates from the internal silencing of console output at package initialization to suppress potential messages from the GiNaC C++ library.
The package itself does not actively use `std::cout` or `std::cerr`, and no runtime output is generated by the package.
Console output streams are redirected at load time to ensure a clean R session.

- No other errors, warnings, or notes were found during R CMD check.
- R CMD check was run with `--as-cran`.
